Description:Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Overview: This project conducts an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the iconic Titanic dataset. Leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we visualize the data to uncover patterns and insights regarding passenger survival rates.
Project Highlights:
Data Manipulation and Analysis: Efficiently handled using Pandas.
Visualizations: Utilized bar plots, heatmaps, and scatter plots to explore relationships and correlations.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Ensured accuracy in analysis through thorough data cleaning.
Key Insights:
Higher survival rates among female passengers and those in first class.
Strong correlation between passenger class and survival chances.
Age and fare exhibit significant patterns affecting survival likelihood.
Importance of EDA:
EDA is crucial for understanding datasets, identifying patterns, and guiding further analysis or modeling work. This project showcases the importance of EDA in extracting meaningful insights from data.
